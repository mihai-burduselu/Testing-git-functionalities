	I made this repository to test the functionalities of git and to be more familiar with this version control system.
	I merged branches 4 times.
	I had 2 pull request for Version_1.1 and Version_1 branches.
	The first pull request was automatically merged.
	At the second one, I opened hello.cpp file and I edited it manually to keep some instructions from every branch.
	The "cout" line was the conflict because master and Version_1 made a change on a particular line.
